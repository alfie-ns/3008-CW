# COMP3008

## Set Exercises

### Set-exercise 1:

- [ ] Create a Neo4j database to store the data comprised in the CSV files. The database should respect the data model displayed in the example in the figure below, please note that the image below has had some nodes hidden for clarity. You have to provide all the commands needed to create the database and populate it with the data in the CSV files, and you must provide them in the exact order you propose to execute them. If you create indexes, you must also include the commands for index creation. Your database will be recreated, and the only way to do so is by following the commands that you will provide, in the order in which you provide them.

### Set-exercise 2

- [ ] Produce a Neo4j query to list all the countries that have won the competition more than twice. The query should include the country and be listed in descending order, that is the country which has won the greatest number of times should be listed first, followed by the country which has the second greatest, and so on. Your answer must show the query followed by the result with the columns appropriately named.

### Set-exercises 3

- [ ] Produce a Neo4j query to find all the host countries which then also went on to win the contest that year. The query should list the winning nations, the song they won with and the year in which hey won returned in chronological order. You should submit the query and the result with the columns appropriately named.

### Set-exercise 4

- [ ] Produce a Neo4j query to identify all the persistent friendships between countries. The query should list both countries and the number of points given. The query result should be listed in alphabetical order by the country giving the points. You should submit the query and the result with the columns appropriately named.

**Submission Requirements:**

- [ ] Query and results submitted as a single TXT document to DLE
- [ ] Appendix with completed Generative Al Declaration

## Report

You have been provided with data from the UK Annual Population Survey from January 2019 to December 2024 in two separate cs files. The UK government wants to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted employment patterns and regional economies.

To do this you need to use a range of big data analysis techniques. The report should contain commentary on the results of each of the analysis techniques you apply to the data and your final insights and recommendations, with justification.

Your report should include how the data has been pre-processed, at least three different methods for exploratory analysis and at least two methods for predictive modelling, where you need to comment on the suitability and accuracy of each of the methods.

REPORT REQUIREMENTS

The report should fulfil the following requirements:

* ﻿﻿You should write your report so that it is understandable and accessible, you can assume the reader is familiar with the COMP3008 material and do not wish to see it reiterated in your report
* ﻿﻿Your report should provide details of the methods applied for the predictive modelling.
* ﻿﻿Your work on this assignment should involve considerable reading and research from multiple appropriate sources-the Internet is a good place to start, but do not stop there; consider also books and preferably academic articles. Include a reference list, and make sure that your report contains citations to the sources in your reference list and using Harvard style referencing.
* ﻿﻿When citing sources, ensure that you provide clear and explicit information about the contents of the cited source, so that the relationship between the contents of the source and the points being made are clear.

Consider the following points before starting your write-up:

The length of the report should be 3500 words (+/-10%). Include a word count immediately after your report title penalty of 5 marks will be applied for omitting the word count. Reports exceeding the maximum word length will be penalised. Your reference list is not included in the word count. If you produce appendices, these are not included in the word count.

Please note that a significant amount of substantive content is expected: Do not waste words on

"conversational", verbose, or rambling English. Be concise!

You will be writing a report, not a journal or conference paper—hence, there is no need for an Abstract. You are not writing a dissertation or a book either. Thus, there is no need for Terms of Reference; Aims and Objectives; Methodology; Foreword.

Please avoid overly long sentences: 30 words is a long sentence and needs strong use of proper punctuation to be intelligible. Reconsider sentences once they go over 20 words.

Ensure that your writing is clear, and concise. Keep it simple, readable, and clear. Conciseness helps the reader to understand the intended message and will also help you to meet the word limit.

Ensure that your report has a clear structure in terms of numbered sections, sub-sections (if necessary and paragraphs.

Ensure that any plots included are legible at 100% zoom.

**Submission Requirements:**

- 3500-word limit
- Report submitted at as single PDF document to DLE
- Appendix with completed Generative Al Declaratio

Inline with the indicated acceptable level of Al use above, the following uses are acceptable:
- A1 - Idea Generation and Problem Exploration
- A5 - Language Refinement
- A7 - Code Generation for Learning Purposes

**Assessment Criteria:**

The following marking scheme will be used for this part of the assessment:
- Literature review (10 Marks)
- Overview of the methods used in report (10 Marks)
- Pre-processing of the data (10 Marks)
- Application of the methods (20 Marks)
- Results (10 Marks)
- Conclusion (5 Marks)
- Reference list (5 Marks)

An illustration of the feedback template is presented in Table 3.

| | Criteria | Weighting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Is there a properly constructed reference list and are the elements of such a list cited appropriately in the report? | 5 marks |
| 2 | Is the research carried out appropriate in terms of breadth and depth? The relation between the cited sources and the report are clearly explained. | 10 marks |
| 3 | Does the report provide an overview of the specific methods (at least 3 exploratory methods and at least 2 predictive methods) used to analyse the data, and is this clearly and explicitly based upon evidence and citations from the literature? | 10 marks |
| 4 | Does the report explain how the data has been pre-processed and the effects of this? | 10 marks |
| 5 | Does the report provide a detailed analysis that adequately describes the results of applying the different methods? Is the solution supported by appropriate evidence? | 20 marks |
| 6 | Does the report propose insights and recommendations? Does the report identify reasons for these? Is this clearly and explicitly supported by evidence? Are such examples presented and discussed in sufficient depth? | 10 marks |
| 7 | Is there a set of conclusions, and do they provide a reasonable summary – at an appropriate level of abstraction – based upon the contents of the report? | 5 marks |

Marking criteria to work towards: (70%+) The quality of work is outstanding with no significant flaws. It demonstrates a high level of subject knowledge and competence; personal thoroughness, effort and independent learning; and possibly significant additional analytical/critical thought. Well
